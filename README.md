## Rhino Splits

Rhino Splits is my Front-End capstopne projects at NSS. This is online payment simulator that users can sign in with Google account and create a new friend or contact. User is able to edit and delete the current user as well as make a payment to a friend. I'm planing to keep working on this project and add reminder and sending notification for frineds who are supposed to pay you back.
